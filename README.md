ðŸ“¡ Smart Weather Web App

This is a Python-based Automated Weather Reminder web application designed to help users stay prepared for rainy days. The app uses the Google Weather API to fetch daily weather forecasts and determines if rain is expected in the user's specified location. If rain is likely, the app can notify users, helping them remember to bring an umbrella before they head out.

The application features a simple and user-friendly interface built with HTML, Bootstrap, and Flask. Users can enter their email address and location through a web form, which the backend uses to retrieve weather data and prepare alerts.

The project is built to be lightweight, easy to use, and extensible â€” ideal for future upgrades like scheduling daily reminders, integrating email notifications, or saving user preferences in a database. It serves as a practical demonstration of integrating APIs, handling form data, and building a responsive frontend with Python web frameworks.
